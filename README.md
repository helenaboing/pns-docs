# 🔗 PNS: Your Identity in Polkadot

## Why PNS Matters

Imagine sending tokens to `0x6C6b33B45573DE6C04E7b644246129DDb3d8610D` when you could just use `alice.dot`. PNS transforms complex Polkadot addresses into human-readable names, making web3 more accessible and safer.

### Real-world Impact

- ✅ Send assets to `company.dot` instead of `0x6C6...10D`
- 🔒 Reduce transaction errors
- 🌐 One name works across all Polkadot parachains
- 🎯 Build your web3 identity and brand
