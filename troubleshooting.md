# PNS Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve common issues you might encounter while using the Polkadot Naming Service (PNS).

## Common Issues

### Transaction Failures

If you're experiencing transaction failures, try the following:

1. **Check Gas Fees**
   - Ensure you have enough WND tokens for gas
   - Verify the gas price is appropriate for the network
   - Consider increasing gas limit if needed

2. **Network Connection**
   - Verify you're connected to the correct network (Westend Asset Hub testnet)
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **Wallet Balance**
   - Ensure you have sufficient WND tokens
   - Check for any pending transactions
   - Verify your wallet is properly connected

### Name Registration Issues

If you're having trouble registering a name:

1. **Name Availability**
   - Verify the name isn't already taken
   - Check if the name follows the allowed format
   - Ensure you're using valid characters

2. **Name Format**
   - Use only Latin alphabet letters (A-Z, a-z)
   - Numbers (0-9) are allowed
   - No spaces or special characters
   - Only approved suffixes (.dot, .jam) are allowed

3. **Registration Process**
   - Ensure you have enough WND tokens
   - Check if your wallet is properly connected
   - Verify you're on the correct network

### Resolution Problems

If you're having trouble resolving names:

1. **Name Verification**
   - Double-check the spelling of the name
   - Verify the name exists in the system
   - Check if the name has expired

2. **Resolver Settings**
   - Verify the resolver is properly configured
   - Check if records are set correctly
   - Ensure the resolver is active

3. **Network Issues**
   - Confirm you're on the correct network
   - Check network status for any outages
   - Verify your connection is stable
