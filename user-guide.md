# PNS User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Polkadot Naming Service (PNS) user guide. This guide will help you understand how to use PNS to manage your blockchain identities and addresses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. A Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
2. Some test tokens (WND) on the Westend Asset Hub testnet

### Connecting Your Wallet

For the best experience and compatibility, we recommend using MetaMask on Google Chrome. Other wallet options (such as Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, or WalletConnect) may appear as options in the interface, but we have only tested MetaMask and cannot guarantee that the others will work correctly at this time.

Follow these steps to connect MetaMask:

1. **Install Google Chrome**
   - Make sure you are using the Google Chrome browser on your computer

2. **Add MetaMask Extension**
   - Go to the MetaMask website and click "Download"
   - Select "Chrome" and follow the instructions to add MetaMask to your browser extensions
   - Once installed, you'll see the MetaMask fox icon 🦊 in your browser's extension bar

3. **Set Up or Import a Wallet**
   - Click the MetaMask icon 🦊
   - Follow the prompts to create a new wallet or import an existing one using your seed phrase
   - Set a secure password for your wallet

4. **Connect MetaMask to PNS**
   - Visit the PNS web app
   - Click the "Connect Wallet" button
   - When prompted, select MetaMask
   - Approve the connection in the MetaMask popup

## Managing Your Names

### Registering and Setting Up Your Name

#### Step 1: Choose and Register Your Name

1. Choose your desired name (e.g., "myname.dot")
2. Check name availability
3. Click "Get (myname) now! 🚀"
4. Approve the transaction in your wallet
5. Wait for confirmation

#### Step 2: Set Up Your Profile

After registration, you can customize your profile. Each update requires a gas fee transaction, so it's best to add all information at once.

1. Search your profile name
2. Click "View profile"
3. Click the edit icon ✏️
4. Fill in your profile information:
   - Display name 👤
   - Description 📝
   - Email address 📧
   - Website 🌐
   - Twitter 🐦
   - Telegram 📱
   - Discord 💬
   - Profile Image URL 🖼️
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Approve the gas fee transaction in your wallet

Note: You don't need to share all information - you can choose which details to make public. Each update will require a separate gas fee transaction.

#### Name Requirements

When creating a domain name, please follow these guidelines:

##### ✅ Allowed Characters

- **Latin alphabet letters** (A–Z, a–z)
- **Numbers** (0–9)

##### ❌ Not Allowed

- **Spaces** (e.g., `helena boing` is invalid)
- **Emojis** (e.g., `🌟helena` is invalid)
- **Dots between words** (e.g., `helena.boing` is invalid)

##### ✅ Valid Examples

- `helena123.dot`
- `helena.dot`
- `helena.jam`

##### Name Length Requirements

- Names must be at least 3 characters long
- Only names with **approved suffixes** like `.dot` and `.jam` are accepted

### Transferring Names

1. Click the transfer icon (user pen)
2. Enter the recipient's address
3. Confirm the transfer
4. Approve the transaction

## Security

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Your Private Keys Safe**
   - Never share your private keys
   - Use hardware wallets for large holdings
   - Enable 2FA where available

2. **Verify Transactions**
   - Always check transaction details
   - Verify recipient addresses
   - Review gas fees

3. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Monitor name expiration
   - Update records when needed
   - Keep resolver information current

### Common Scams

1. **Phishing Attempts**
   - Be wary of fake PNS websites
   - Verify website URLs
   - Don't share private keys

2. **Fake Support**
   - Official support won't ask for private keys
   - Use official channels only
   - Verify support staff identity
